# Springboot-Swagger2

Hi I'm Saurabh Kumar, 
As a java developer, I'm learning Swagger API to documenting the API's that i have created,
following the course of Kaushik Kothagal(Java Brains).

I've learned how to use Swagger API in out Spring Boot application,
like adding the dependency of Swagger2 and Swagger-ui and creating Docket bean using builder pattern and configuring the ApiInfo.

It was amazing to learn Swagger thanks to Kaushik.
